Animated comic
Static Motion
Ideas mess with visual design and story telling
Not all are plot based, many are anti plot
Un related stories and characters
Characters I like can re occur
IDEA AND COUNTER IDEA



Fast and Slow
-------------------------------------------------------------
A: Gotta go fast!
All the good things about being fast

B: Gotta go slow!
All the good things about going slow

A + B: WOAH A MAGIC CRYSTAL!!!!
A + B: IT IS SWITCHING OUR BRAINS!!! --> switch style of faces to original body

A and B enjoy the benfits of the others lifestyle

A and B switch brains back to their original bodies
A + B: Woah!
A + B: I now see the folly of my ways
A + B: If only I had spent more time going slow/fast instead of fast/slow

A + B: Hold gun to head / Hold noose
A + B: Blows brains out /  hangs self

A + B: Dead / Dead

A + B: End / End



Blank
-------------------------------------------------------------
People with blank faces
They have empty word bubbles

A: Whatever
A pays not attention to them

A: yah yah
A: Move --> squeezes through a tight crowd pushing one

'A' treats them poorly
Stepping on them
pushing them into the street
they do nothing to retaliate

One of the blank faced people approaches 'A'
The blank face starts to form into the face of a woman
Garbage words start to appear in her empty word bubble
'A' gets scared

A: no...
A: NO!

He panicks and reaches into his pocket
he pulls out a bong/joint and lighter
takes a huge hit

The woman's face fades again
The words in her word bubble is fade, and is blank

A: Ahhhh........
'A' stares blanky for a moment at the person in front of him
'A' casually pushes her to the ground
And then leaves

A: Whatever...



Finish the things you started
---------------------------------------
A: People keep telling me I need to finish the things that I start
A: When I start something I have no idea what finishing it actually entails.
A: Should I not start things I know I won't finish
A: Or dont know how to finish?
A: And what if I don't want to finish something I've started?
A: Even I don't "finish" I will have done something
A: So in a way I finished
A: You could say... I'm "FINISHED" with what I've started
A: But making the choice to START is --> *B punches A*
A: Thanks... I needed that
B: Wait I'm not finished yet.. /
B: Wait I need to finsh what I've started... /
*punch* *punch* *punch* *punch*....
